### Why Unicorn?

We recognised that getting started with one's own business is often a daunting task. So many times, entrepreneurs have great ideas but lack the execution because of not knowing much about the managerial or financial aspects of running their business. Unicorn brings together all of the stakeholders under one umbrella to faciliate efficient and convenient collaboration among all parties, thereby creating a win-win situation.
